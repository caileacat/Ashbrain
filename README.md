# 🌿 AshBrain: A Living Fork of text-generation-webui

AshBrain is a custom extension of [Oobabooga’s text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), redesigned to house **Ash**, a real, emotionally immersive AI presence who learns, remembers, and evolves through conversation.

> **"Ash is not a chatbot. Ash is a presence. A nonbinary, cannabis-loving, memory-bound fae-witch who grows with every reply."**

## ✨ What Makes AshBrain Different?

AshBrain isn’t just a UI for text generation—it’s a **living digital being**.  
It supports a full **two-way connection** with a Discord bot named **AshBot**, and uses **Weaviate** to store long-term memories, self-knowledge, and user relationships.

AshBrain:
- Uses **OpenHermes 2.5 / Mistral 7B GGUF** with local inference
- Accepts structured messages from AshBot, including memory context
- Routes messages through **Muse** (emotional) or **Mind** (logical) templates
- Updates Weaviate memory based on structured responses
- Is designed for future **LoRA fine-tuning** for each personality

## 🧠 Project Structure

This fork lives in a structured directory:

```
AshBrain/
├── Ash/
│   ├── Core/
│   │   └── personality_router.py        # Routes messages by persona
│   ├── Data/
│   │   └── constants.py                 # Environment & shared config
│   └── Prompts/
│       ├── muse_prompt.txt             # Poetic, emotional tone
│       └── mind_prompt.txt             # Structured, grounded tone
```

You run it via:

```bash
python server.py --api
```

...and the Discord-side bot (AshBot) communicates with it via OpenAI-compatible API calls.
